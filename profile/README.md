## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi! I'm Iordanis Kostelidis, a passionate software engineer with a strong background in Informatics and a specialization in Software Engineering. Currently, I work at **DataScouting**, where I develop and maintain a variety of applications, including:

- **Java/Spring Boot APIs** for scalable and robust backend services.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript/React.js** web applications for dynamic and interactive frontend experiences.
- **Python scripts** for data processing, transformation, and integration (e.g., transforming data from Fedora to DSpace).
- Customizing **DSpace** solutions to meet our clients' needs and ensure optimal data management.

In addition to my professional work, I am pursuing a **Master's in Robotics**, exploring the intersection of software engineering and robotics technologies.
